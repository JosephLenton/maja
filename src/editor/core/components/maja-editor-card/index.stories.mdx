# Editor Card

import { Meta, Story, Canvas } from '@storybook/addon-docs'
import { EditorCard } from './index'
import { EditorCardButton } from './../maja-editor-card-button'

<Meta title="Editor/EditorCard" component={EditorCard} />

The editor card exists to provide floating content on top of the editor canvas area.

## A button example

It aims to hold multiple buttons, and similar custom components.

<EditorCard>
  <EditorCardButton>+</EditorCardButton>
  <EditorCardButton>-</EditorCardButton>
  <EditorCardButton>🗑️</EditorCardButton>
  <EditorCardButton>💾</EditorCardButton>
  <EditorCardButton>😍</EditorCardButton>
</EditorCard>

## A poor example

Be aware it provides no padding. This is intentional.
Anything placed into the card needs to be styled as appropriate.

<EditorCard>
  this is some text plonked straight into the card.
</EditorCard>
